# Solution
This challenge was comprised of some reverse image search and websites that publish flight data publicly. 
When you run the container it asked for the next destination from Tokyo.  
That suggests that plane in the provided image is of an airport in Tokyo.

#
A simple reverse image search shows that this exact image is present on the website [https://www.jetphotos.com/photo/11621371](url)  
When you click on the registration of the aircraft it shows an option for flight history, which redirects you to [flightradar24.com](url).  
**The free account of flightradar24 only shows the flight history of last seven days.**
This history shows that this aircraft went to these locations after Tokyo:  
Istanbul -> Beijing -> Istanbul -> Los Angeles -> Istanbul -> Dubai -> Istanbul -> Miami -> Istanbul  
After entering all these nine cities correctly you would get the flag.
